HTML creates the structure of a webpage.

Difference between div and semantic tags.
div is a non-semantic tag, and is acts like a container, where other tags are stored. Whereas, Semantic tags have proper meaning, for example: header, main etc.

What confused you the most?
Trouble part was the button, at first when I clicked the button, nothing was happening...
and also the semantics tags were confusing me.
