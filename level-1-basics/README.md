According to me, Git means where all the files are stored and helps to
make changes, while Github is online website, where evryone can see others
work, and can work together also.

Git repository means files saved in computer, while Github repository means
saves in website, needs wifi to open.

Difficulty faced was just the starting trouble, it was that do i have git in
my device, PLus i still dont actually understand the actual use and meaning 
of GIt and github, even after researching.
